# Meridian Hiring Dashboard

This is a web application that visualizes the hiring data for Meridian over different time periods using various charts. The application is built using React and Highcharts. This project was created as part of my learning to display data dynamically based on filtering and integrating real-time data analytics using Highcharts with a React application. This will help businesses to have good data visualization and improve their decision-making. I have taken a sample data of a company named Meridian that hires a certain number of people every month.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Filtering:** Select custom date ranges, quarters, half-years, or years to filter and view the hiring data.
- **Quarterly Data:** View hiring data grouped by quarters for a selected year.
- **Half-Yearly Data:** View hiring data grouped by half-year periods for a selected year.
- **Annual Data:** View hiring data grouped by years within a selected date range.
- **Highcharts Integration:** Data visualizations are displayed using Highcharts for an interactive and professional look.
